Machine Learning in production: the Booking.com approach
requirements
1. consistency
2. high availability
3. low latency
4. observability- We need tools to make sure we can observe our models to react appropriately and promptly.
5. reusability

Fantastic four
1. lookup tables- Most of our models map an input vector to a prediction (or set of predictions in the case of recommender systems). A very simple way to deploy a model in production is to precompute all the predictions for all the possible inputs and store them in a key-value store.
2. Generalized linear models- didn't get
3. Native libraries
4. Scripted models- A scripted model is simply a script with a predefined interface that is invoked for every request.


Supporting Machine Learning at scale involves many challenges, not least of which is shipping the models to production reliably, as fast as possible and accommodating a large variety of model types, invocation settings, libraries, data sources, monitoring approaches, etc.
The process of taking a working machine-learned model and integrating it with the relevant system, making it available to our customers, is what we call productionization. 
Upgrading a model, scaling it to a wider audience, maintaining the hosts where it runs, testing new tools, etc. must not interfere with the availability of the model in production. 


5 Steps for Building Machine Learning Models for Business

Below, we’ll share five steps and supporting tips on approaching machine learning from a business perspective. We’ve used these steps and tips at Shopify to help build and scale our suite of machine learning products.

Data is what makes or breaks any machine learning model, and having a solid strategy for data collection will serve the team and product for years to come.
